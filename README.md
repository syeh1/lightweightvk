LightweightVK [![Build Status](https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/corporateshark/lightweightvk/actions)
========================

LightweightVK is a deeply refactored fork of [IGL](https://github.com/facebook/igl) which is designed to run on top of Vulkan 1.3.

The main goals of LightweightVK:

1. **Lean.** Minimalistic API without bloat (no `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map` etc in the API).
2. **Bindless.** Utilize Vulkan 1.3+ dynamic rendering, descriptor indexing, and buffer device address features for modern bindless-only API design.
3. **Agile.** A playground for experiments to enable quick exploration of ideas and adoption of Vulkan API changes.
Designed for rapid prototyping of Vulkan-based renderers.

There are no plans to keep this fork in sync with the upstream.

## Supported rendering backends

 * Vulkan 1.3 (Windows, Linux, Android)
 * Vulkan 1.2 + extensions (MacOS)

## Supported platforms

 * Linux
 * Windows
 * MacOS (via MoltenVK)
 * Android

On MacOS, features required by LightweightVK are available via extensions `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`, `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control`,
`VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state`, `VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2`, and `VK_KHR_synchronization2`.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: `VK_KHR_maintenance4` is not yet supported in MoltenVK :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Check the status of [Vulkan 1.3 support](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK/issues/1930) in MoltenVK.

## Build

Before building, run the deployment scripts:

```
python3 deploy_content.py
python3 deploy_deps.py

```

These scripts download external third-party dependencies. Please check [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for the full list.

### Windows

```
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

### Linux

```
sudo apt-get install clang xorg-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libstdc++-12-dev extra-cmake-modules libxkbcommon-x11-dev wayland-protocols
cd build
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
```

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Use `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DLVK_WITH_WAYLAND=ON` to build for Wayland, X11 is used by default.

### MacOS

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Be sure that VulkanSDK 1.3.275.0 for MacOS is installed https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac

```
cd build
cmake .. -G "Xcode"
```

### Android

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Be sure that [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is set up.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Be sure that the `ANDROID_NDK` environment variable points to your Android NDK.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Be sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the path of the Java Runtime.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Be sure that the `adb` platform tool is in the `PATH` environment variable.

```
cd build
cmake .. -DLVK_WITH_SAMPLES_ANDROID=ON
cd android/Tiny                         # or any other sample
./gradlew assembleDebug                 # or assembleRelease
```
You can also open the project in Android Studio and build it from there.

Before running demo apps on your device, connect the device to a desktop machine and run the deployment script:

```
python3 deploy_content_android.py
```

> NOTE: To run demos on an Android device, it should support Vulkan 1.3. Please check https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listdevices.php?platform=android 

> NOTE: At the moment, no touch input is supported on Android.
